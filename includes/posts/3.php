	<h2>11/12/2015 - Site overhaul, new features</h2>
	<p>
	Well, after having been offline for some months, the website is back up. Since it's hosted by myself at home and we moved to a new place, the chaotic nature of change meant that the server was ignored while other, more pressing tasks took precedent. But hurrah! From change comes growth, and with the latest change comes a site overhaul. Upon the suggestion of my good friend and collegue, <a href="http://www.jackalbright.com" target ="_blank">Jack Albright</a>, I've completely rewritten the website in PHP, and boy am I glad. This has lead to a greater deal of managability, flexibility, and extra features that weren't available with the old, crappy, table-based (ugh) HTML site. A million thanks to Jack. 
	<p>
	I've also updated my <a href="portfolio.php">portfolio</a> page, including a lot of new projects I've created in my recent position as Unix admin. If you're interested, feel free to stop over there and check it out.
