	      <p>So, I'm hosting my own website now. I installed Slackware on my little server, got Apache up and running, registered the domain name, purchasesd a DDNS service, and set up port forwarding on the router. 
	      It's been a busy day! It may seem small, but it feels huge to me, like I've proved to myself that I can acutally do it. 
	      It's acutally quite empowering. 
	      Now I'll even have access to my files from anywhere! 
	      I don't need to pay monthly hosting fees; it was dirt cheap and acutally pretty easy. 
	      Perhaps the first display of my real skills? More to come later!
